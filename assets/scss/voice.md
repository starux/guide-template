## Voice and Tone


### Our Mission

To enrich homes with stylish, affordable, high-quality appliances. We are committed to selling high-quality products from trusted brands that enrich your home. 


#### About LivingDirect.com - Appliances to Enrich Your Home

We strive to make online shopping and delivery for today's popular and luxury home appliances quick, easy and affordable. We are experts and wear many hats. So whether you’re writing a blog post, a product description, a headline, or something else, this guide will cover some basics about how we write and our personality. Consider this a set of standards to help you write solid and engaging copy that suits our site — these are not hard and fast rules. Oh, and we aren't grammar nerds, so don’t get caught up in the technicalities. And have fun! 


### Our Voice

LivingDirect’s voice is human. It’s kind, it's familiar, it’s friendly, and it’s straightforward. Our priority is to help our customers get on with their lives in a more enriching way. **Imagine saying things with a smile.** We use language that empowers and inspires people without patronizing or confusing them.

LivingDirect's unofficial tagline is “Lagniappe” (to give a litle extra) and that spirit should come through in every piece we produce.

 We don't try to be funny, punny or ironic. Don’t make jokes, just be straightforward and nice. Our tone is usually informal, but it’s more important to be clear than entertaining.


#### We Write With...

1) Emotion, not Intellect
	We write **emotional copy** because it tells readers what they already know to be true, subtly inserting a new perspective that influences them to feel differently about the information. **Intellectual copy** presents new information in an attempt to lead readers to a new conclusion. _Evoke happy, nice, and comforting emotions._

2) Now, not Then or Before
	We write in the present tense because it places the reader directly in the action and most effectively engages the brain.

3) You, not Me or Them
	First person perspective is that of the speaker: I am standing. Second person perspective is that of the reader: The copy starts with "You are standing in the snow, 5 ½ miles above sea level…" Third person perspective is that of the outsider: They are standing. In general, people tend to find first and third person perspectives less engaging. Second person perspective puts you right there in the action - you, the person you care most about. To your readers, it's them. When your goal is to persuade action, the "understood you" is extremely powerful: it's the imperative call to act ("Click here"); it's the avenue that will lead your readers to the richest, most satisfying mental imagery.

4) Time, not Money
	Business owners like to think their products or services are money-driven: "It has always been and it will always be about price." But it's only that way because we think about it that way, because advertising promotes products and services based on price. Yet these days, particularly in the United States, the customer is more often interested in saving time. For our customers we want them to not just save time, but have a good time.

5) Style, before Substance
	We are going to **sell style** before substance in our writing. This coincides with selling emotion and not intellect. However, style and substance are not mutually exclusive - just lead or lean with style.

6) Gain, not Pain
	Our writing should appeal to what our reader's stand to gain. This doesn't imply taking a risk on something, it means speaking directly to the guaranteed benefits. Writing about what the reader stands to gain also doesn't mean speculating or proposing ideas. Simply put, speak to what matters.

7) Informal, not Formal and not Slang
	We write the way our reader's talk - do not write like a lawyer or business - but we do use proper words and punctuation sparingly.


### Living Direct's Tone

There’s a difference between voice and tone. Look at it this way: You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might speak in one tone to your closest friends and family, and a different tone with your boss. Your tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person you’re addressing. You wouldn’t use the same tone of voice with someone who’s scared or upset as you would with someone who’s laughing. Same goes for Living Direct's voice. Our voice doesn’t change much from day to day, but our tone changes all the time.

The tone of this guide has been inspired by [voiceandtone.com](http://voiceandtone.com/public-site/).

### Content Types

Our web properties have many different types of content ranging from educational to purchase driving. The following explains the purpose of each and any minimums or maximams required.


#### Learning Center Posts

Learning Center posts are typically 150-800 words and written in the author’s own, first-person voice. They’re informative, entertaining, and written for customers. Topics are organized into one of three tiers: Current Events, Lifestlye, or Product focused.

Why we do it: To build loyal customers and spread our brand. To educate and entertain our users. To show them that we love what we do.


##### Product Posts

Product posts are articles that focus on a particular product or a set of products, whether to compare features or feature why you should have one. These posts should educate the user about why these products fit a lifestyle, contains factual data, and help the customer choose one or more of the products.


###### Case studies

Case studies are posts that explain how customers use a particular product or feature. The format is flexible—sometimes it’s a list of ways to do something, sometimes it’s a step-by-step explanation of how a user accomplihed something, and sometimes it’s a video interview. Case studies are straightforward and informative. Written case studies are usually 150-600 words, and every one includes at least one image or screenshot.

Why we do it: To show how real customers are using our products.


##### Lifestyle Posts

Lifestyle posts are articles that focus on living better. They do not refer to specific products but they can refer to a category of products and solutions that will benefit the topic lifestyle. These posts should teach our readers something new or how to live better.


###### [Catagory] in Action

We’ve got a lot of awesome products, and the "[Category] in Action" series is a way for us to brag about what they can do. We create fun videos to demonstrate the way we use them. They’re educational and entertaining, and they focus on real life uses and how we love to use them, even in interesting ways. 

Why we do it: To show potential and existing customers how much you can do with the products we sell, and to share a little bit about what makes us special as a company.


##### Current Event Posts

Current Event posts are articles about what's in the news around a lifestyle. These articles reference case studies and 3rd party reports. These posts should align with the interests of the users of each lifestyle we support. If our users are interested in a lifestyle then they will be interestee in knowing we are too and that we are their 1-stop shop for news, guidance and what to buy.


#### Guides

Guides are written in third-person and have a friendly but straightforward tone, as readers want answers pronto. They vary in length from five pages to 50. They either teach readers about specific products, like: how to configure, install, use or troubleshoot issues with their products. Or, they help users make a buying decision - for example by asking and answering a series of questions that result in our recommendation. They often feature screenshots, educational materials, and step-by-step instructions. Guides are available in web, PDF, and mobile formats.

Why we do it: To educate users, make them more self-sufficient, and answer questions they don’t know they have.


#### Knowledge Base

Living Direct’s Knowledge Base (KB) is a self-service support center with hundreds of help articles for customers who have bought something from us. It’s updated every day. When our customers read help articles or watch help videos, they’re trying to solve problems quickly, so the tone should be direct and clear and the article well structured with clear headings and related tags. Most KB articles are 300-800 words.

Why we do it: To answer specific questions, educate users, and get them back to using their products as quickly as possible.


#### e-Commerce Content

Our e-commerce site shows people why they should buy from us and how to quickly find what you're looking for. Occasionally we need to suppliment the navigation with some content that helps educate the customer before they buy or continuing their product research. The tone of the content is approachable and occasionally playful, and the content is informative. It’s written with potential customers in mind.

Why we do it: To show people why they should buy from Living Direct and demonstrate our expertise while providing useful resources for them.


##### Landing pages

Landing pages are created with specific types of customers in mind. They are rarely linked from the e-commerce site, and they typically explain why a certain type of customer should use a category or group of products. For example, a landing page called "Air Conditioners For Your Tiny House" explains why folks with Tiny Houses love the products we sell, links to our Portable Air Conditioning guide, and highlights specific features and ways to use a Portable A/C in a Tiny House. Landing pages are approachable and informative, like the web site. We like to commission original portraits of customers for this kind of marketing content.

Why we do it: To show certain segments of customers why what we sell is a good fit for them.


##### Product Videos

Product videos are no longer than 1min 30sec. They provide the user with enough information to know the key selling points of the product and how most people use the product. This informs the potential buyer about the features and capabilities that they would otherwise read in the product description while also being able to see the specific features being referred to in the product description.

Why we do it: To make it easier for a customer to know whether this is the right product for them.


##### Learning Center Content

We bring content from our learning center and add it to areas of the site where customers are making a decision. These are known as key decisions points along the path to a purchase. The learning center content is either a link to an article or a video about what the are interested in learning about. The content we showcase must be targeted for that key decision point and it should carry the same tone as the learning center.

#### Microcopy

Microcopy is that small but oh-so-important instructional copy that you usually see in forms and feedback messages. It might remind a user that her password has to contain a number or explain that email communication will only be used regarding a specific order. We also call it "bird seed text," and you see it both on the website and in emails. It’s short and to-the-point.

Why we do it: To help users complete tasks and understand limitations or exclusions, and we do it for legal reasons too.


#### Email newsletters

Living Direct’s email newsletters are friendly updates about our products and sales. Each email has one or more articles and links surrounding a specific theme or topoc. We use a lot of imagery to tell the story and the tone is casual and entertaining.

Why we do it: To sell products, inspire, and build loyalty and increase engagement with our brand.


#### Social media

Living Direct has a Facebook page, where we post links, make announcements and connect with users. Facebook posts are conversational and informative.

Why we do it: To provide our customers with information about their lifestyles, entertain with fun content, and inspire them to explore and share the solutions, content and products we tout.


### Writing for the Web

Our customers (and potential customers) have a lot going on. They’ve probably got more than a few browser windows open at any given time, and most importantly, they have a product or passion they're interest in — that’s why they’re on our site in the first place. We respect their busy lives and don’t waste their time with meaningless or too-long content. Online content should be scannable and easy to digest. We love short paragraphs and lists. Write clear and compelling content, and don’t use long or confusing words unless it’s absolutely necessary.


#### Web Guidelines

We follow general grammar guidelines but there are some exceptions to that rule, and topics worth mentioning twice. Read the following for details.


##### Call to Actions

Button text always actionable, like Sign Up Free, Learn More, and Subscribe. Buttons use title case. The copy is short and straightforward.

Our standard website buttons include:

Save Now
Add to Cart
Sign Up Free
Subscribe
Email Us
Checkout Now

Links always describe the destination they take the user to. The links will adopt the sentence casing of the sentence they belong to. If they are used outside of a sentence, like as a button, then they will have title casing.

Our standard links include:

Log In
[Product Name]


##### Email Addresses

Use all lowercase for email addresses.

E.g.: _skyler.white@A1Acarwash.com_


##### Heading and Subheadings

Headings and subheadings break articles into smaller, more specific sections. They give readers avenues into your content and make it more scannable. Be generous and descriptive with headings.

Capitalize words (everything except articles, conjunctions, and prepositions) in headings, and always capitalize the first word.


##### Links

Provide a link when referring to a website. Don’t capitalize links or words within links.

Don’t say things like "Click here!" or "Click for more information." Write the sentence as you normally would, and link relevant keywords.

Links should look different than regular copy - see the style guide for details. They should have a hover state that communicates they’re interactive. When setting the hover state of links, be sure to include focus state as well, to help our customers using assistive technologies or touch devices.


##### Lists

Use lists to present groups of info. Only number lists when order is important (describing steps of a process).

If one of the list items is a complete sentence, use punctuation on all of the items. Otherwise, don’t use punctuation in lists.

1. Log in to Living Direct
2. Click Create Campaign.

Don’t use numbers when the list’s order doesn’t matter. Here are some of the integrations we offer:

+ Twitter
+ Salesforce
+ Flickr
+ Eventbrite


##### SEO

Erase this term from your brain. Just write clear and descriptive copy, and use keywords instead of "click here" in link labels.


###### Social networks

Capitalize Twitter but not tweet. Capitalize Facebook but not like.


###### Titles

Titles organize pages and guide readers. A title appears at the beginning of a page or section and briefly describes the content that follows.

Bold titles, and capitalize important words (everything but articles, conjunctions, and prepositions).

Don’t use punctuation in a title unless it’s a question.


#### Grammar and More

Ah, grammar. The fun part. This list includes some exceptions and extra important topics.


##### Abbreviations and acronyms

If there’s a chance a reader won’t recognize an abbreviation or acronym, then spell it out the first time. If the abbreviation is more common than the long form, then just use the short form (DVD, FTP).


##### Ampersands

Only use them in headings.


##### Capitalization

Use common sense. When in doubt, don’t capitalize. Do not capitalize these words: website, internet, online, email


##### Commas

Use the serial or Oxford comma.

We interviewed some of our customers, Oprah, and Justin Timberlake.

Otherwise, follow common sense with commas. Read the sentence out loud. If you need to take a breath, use a comma.


##### Company names and products

Honor companies’ conventions, according to their official websites (iPad, YouTube, Yahoo!).

Refer to a company or product as "it." Refer to Living Direct as "we," and always capitalize the first "L" and the "D."


##### Contractions

Use them!


###### Dates

Spell out the day and abbreviate the month. Sunday, Jan. 24


###### Ellipses

Use ellipses (…) to show that you’re omitting words or trailing off before the end of a thought. Don’t use an ellipsis for emphasis or drama.

Don’t use ellipses in titles or headers, and don’t use an ellipsis when you really should be using a colon (a list is to follow).


###### Em dashes

Use an em dash (—) without spaces for a true break or to set off a parenthetical statement.

Don’t use two hyphens in place of an em dash.


###### Exclamation points

Go easy on the exclamation points! Only use exclamation points when you’re basically giving someone a high five. Never use them in failure messages or alerts.


###### Extreme writing

Don’t use any combination of the following or it looks CRAZY: **_italic, bold_**, CAPS, underline.


###### Hyphens

Use a hyphen without spaces to link words to form a single phrase, or to indicate a span or range. first-time user


###### Italics

Use _Italicize_ to emphasize a word, cite an example, or indicate the title of a long work (books, movies, albums).


###### Strong

Use **Strong** sparingly to emphasize a keyword or important phrase someone might be looking for when scanning a page for the information/content they are seeking. It is like a heading that is embedded in a sentence. Do not make headings strong and do not use more than 2 strong words or phrases in a paragraph.

###### Numbers

Spell out one through nine and first through ninth, and spell out a number if it’s the first word of a sentence. Use numerals in blog posts.

Don’t say "1/2." Instead spell out "half" or use ".5."

Spell out percent.

Use a hyphen for a span of numbers. It takes 20-30 days.


###### Pronouns

Don’t use "they" or "one" as singular pronouns. Use "she" or "he," or avoid it altogether.


###### Quotation marks

Use quotes to refer to words and letters, titles of short works (articles), and—you guessed it—direct quotations.

Periods and commas go within quotation marks. Question marks within quotes follow logic—if the question mark is part of the quotation, it goes within. If you’re asking a question that ends with a quote, it goes outside the quote.

Use single quotation marks for quotes within quotes.


###### Semicolons

Go easy on semicolons. When appropriate, use an em dash (—) instead, or simply start a new sentence.


###### States and cities

Spell out city names, and use postal codes for states. Atlanta, GA


###### Telephone numbers

Use dashes without spaces between numbers and country codes. +1-404-123-4567


###### Times

Use numerals and am or pm without a space. Don’t use minutes for on-the-hour time.
7am
10:30pm

Use a hyphen between times to indicate a time period.
7am-10:30pm


###### Time zones

Continental United States time zones:

Eastern time (ES)
Central time (CS)
Mountain time (MS)
Pacific time (PS)
Abbreviate time zones within the continental United States, and spell out the rest.

List ET first, unless you’re referring to an event that takes place in another time zone. 10am ET
